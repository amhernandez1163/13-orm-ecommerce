During week 13 of UTSA's Coding Bootcamp, we were given a directive of creating a E-commerce back end for an internet retail company because they want to use the lastest technologies. There were a number of requirements to meet, such as:

GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

We were provided starter code from @Xandromus's coding bootcamp repo: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. All other coding was done by me in VS Code and saved in GitHub. This project used ExpressJS, MySQL, Sequelize, dotenv, VSCode, GitHub, and Insomnia.
